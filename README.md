# TRX-Key-Networking-Tool
A companion app for a website that is used to fetch and transfer data in veyr specific ways. Removed the confidential informations so you need your own pre-made SQL server to test it.

All the information you need to use it (you probably don't need to, though, as it's extremely specific) are in the Main.java or in the Javadoc, more simply.
I tried to be as exhaustive as possible.
